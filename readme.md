# SMART MARKET SEGMENTATION (USING AI)

## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging AI and machine learning techniques to analyze sales data in the context of marketing strategies. It explores patterns, trends, and insights to optimize business decisions and enhance marketing effectiveness.

## Project Goals
- Analyze and visualize sales data to identify trends and patterns.
- Implement machine learning models for clustering and predictive analytics.
- Use AI techniques to derive actionable insights for marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset (`sales_data_sample.csv`) containing comprehensive sales records, including product details, customer information, and transaction dates.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Machine Learning:** K-Means Clustering, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Autoencoders
- **Visualization:** Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Steps and Analysis
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and formatting data.
   - Handling missing values and categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing sales trends across different countries and product lines.
   - Analyzing correlations between sales metrics.

3. **Clustering Analysis:**
   - Implementing K-Means clustering to segment customers or products based on sales behavior.
   - Visualizing clusters using PCA for dimensionality reduction.

4. **Autoencoder for Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - Building an autoencoder model to compress and reconstruct sales data.
   - Using reduced dimensions for clustering and visualization.

5. **Visualization and Insights:**
   - Creating interactive visualizations with Plotly for intuitive data exploration.
   - Deriving actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate advanced deep learning models for predictive analytics.
- Explore additional data sources to enrich analysis and insights.
- Deploy models in production for real-time decision-making.
